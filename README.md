I. "Volume Calculator"
A simple program to calculate the volume of various shapes from a list,
including Ellipsoid(Can be a sphere or a "deformed" sphere) and a Torus(Essentially a "donut" shape).
Done for practice of using the input()/raw_input() function and the print() function. 

II. "CS Resource Chatbot"
A small chat bot program for Computer Science resources that I have saved and would like to use in the future.
Done primarily to get practice with manipulating lists and using loops for continued asking for user input.
