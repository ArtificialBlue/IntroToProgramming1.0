I. "Volume Calculator"
A simple program to calculate the volume of various shapes from a list,
including Ellipsoid(Can be a sphere or a "deformed" sphere) and a Torus(Essentially a "donut" shape).
Done for practice of using the input()/raw_input() function and the print() function. 

II. "CS Resource Chatbot"
A small chat bot program for Computer Science resources that I have saved and would like to use in the future.
Done primarily to get practice with manipulating lists and using loops for continued asking for user input. 

III. "Poetry Slam"
Program to read lines from a file and manipulate the order in which the lines from the file are printed.
Function get_file_lines() reads lines from the file and generates a list of strings. 
Function lines_printed_backwards() prints the list of strings in reverse order.
Function lines_printed_random() prints the list of strings in random order, with repeats allowed.
Function lines_printed_custom() prints the list of strings in order of length, from shortest to longest.
