#Greet the user using print() statements and explain what the chat bot topic is and what kind of responses it expects.
print("Welcome to Computer Science ")
print("Please enter how you are feeling")

#Get user input using the input() function and pass that user input to the get_bot_response() function you will write

#Print out the chat botâ€™s response that is returned from the get_bot_response() function

#Use a while() loop to keep running your chat bot until the user enters "done".
